5. [Video Lecture on HCI and Social Computing](https://vimeo.com/463548983)
6. [Bonus Outtake from a Hackathon I hosted for Colleauges in China. Around 10 people the first 3 hours, but by hour four it was me and one person with sketchy internet. This is me filling time while they got back online. Social isolation has dulled my sense of what embarrassing myself looks like, really.](https://vimeo.com/520176208)
