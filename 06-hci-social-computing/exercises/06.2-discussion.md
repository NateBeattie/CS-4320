# 06.2 - Discussion
Using the discussion thread in canvas, Relate your own experiences interacting with people through technology to each of the articles presented. I do not expect you to read every article in its entirety. Much can be garnered by reading the introductions and discussions alone. Also make at least four responses to your course mates posts. The five articles focus on: 
1. Github as "social coding"
2. Online dating as a social computing technology"
3. Social computing for individuals working together in isolated, but connected, rural workplaces
4. Predicting sporting game outcomes by monitoring tweets
5. Constructing a computational model of social computing 

Each article presents a different perspective. 
1. Identify one to two points from **each** of the required readings that you can either relate to from experience, or your observations and discussions with others. 
2. Use these points as the topic of posts you make as **new discussion thread's** for **each** article (five posts). 
3. Respond to four other people's points, being careful not to repeat yourself, and striving to engage in spirited, respectful discussion. **Your answers do not have to be long, but thoughtful.**
