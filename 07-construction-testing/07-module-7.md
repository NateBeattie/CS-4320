# Module Seven
Please consult [assignments](./references/assignments.md) for due dates. 
1. [Readings](./readings/readings.md)
2. [Slides](./slides)
3. [Exercises](./exercises/exercises.md) and especially the README.md that file points you to for getting PyTest setup. 

## Videos
1. [Construction and Testing Lecture](https://vimeo.com/465596201)
2. Monday at 7pm there will be a 'live lecture' where we walk through the testing part of this assignment.  You should take a look now, and give it a try, so you come with questions and problems. Its different than other things you have done before. 

## Python Installation

When It comes to installing Python, many students experience conflicts and issues arising from prior installations, or default installations on their computers. For example, with Augur, there are three primary issues I have seen student developers, and early career developers, go through frequently. We now outline those at the heading of our installation page documentation here: https://oss-augur.readthedocs.io/en/master/getting-started/installation.html and I repeat that here for your convenience: 

1. The absence of a gcc or fortran copiler, required by numpy and nltk python libraries. Look up how to install these compilers for your local operating system. Many times they simply need to be updated to a more current version.
2. Conflicting versions of Python: The fix is platform specific. On Max OSX, more often than not multiple versions of python have been installed by the OS, brew, Anaconda, or a combination of both. The result is some python commands are drawn from different paths because of how they are linked in /usr/local/bin
3. Multiple, or conflicting versions of postgresql. Sometimes, the absence of a functional psql function at the command line results.


### Mac OSX
1. Install "Brew" if you have not already: `https://brew.sh/`
2. `brew install python@3.7`

### Windows
1. I am in the process of getting a Windows computer from our department so I can advise you better on this. Meanwhile, please share what you know with others.
